  > Unifying theory of forecasting:
  > The Golden Rule of Forecasting provides a unifying theory of forecasting. The Rule is to be conservative when forecasting by relying on cumulative knowledge about the situation and about forecasting. Following the Golden Rule guidelines reduces forecast errors by nearly a third, on average, compared to common practice.
  > Superiority of simple forecasting methods:
  > Sophisticatedly simple forecasting methods, which can be understood by decision makers, reduce forecast errors by nearly a quarter, on average, compared to forecasts from complex statistical methods.
